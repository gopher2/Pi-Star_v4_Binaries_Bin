# Pi-Star_v4_Binaries_Bin

There are customized MMDVM binaries by K9DPD. The forked sources of the binaries are published [here](https://github.com/gopher2/MMDVMHost)

# Changes
* 2020/05/11 - MMDVMHost will pass traffic originating from radios with non ham-compliant radio ID's. This allows users with commercial radios that are programmed with trunking radio IDs to also be used on private ham radio networks. These ID's should not be used on the public networks. 

## Installation

Binaries are baked into the updated pi-star sdcard image published at [DetroitP25.com](http://detroitp25.com/)
